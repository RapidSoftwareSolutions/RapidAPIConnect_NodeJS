## Overview
RapidAPI is the world's first opensource API marketplace. It allows developers to discover and connect to the world's top APIs more easily and manage multiple API connections in one place.

## Set-up:

First of all, download the npm module:

    npm install rapidapi-connect --save

Then, require the package in your code:

    const RapidAPI = require('rapidapi-connect');

Once required, the last step is to initialize the SDK with your project name and project API Key:

    const rapid = new RapidAPI('PROJECT_NAME', 'API_KEY');

That's all, your SDK is set up! You can now use any block by copying the code snippet from the marketplace.

## Usage:

To use any block in the marketplace, just copy it's code snippet and paste it in your code. For example, the following is the snippet fot the **Delivery.sendSMS** block:

    rapid.call('Delivery', 'sendSMS', {
        message: 'Hello, connect!',
        to : '4158496404'
    })
        .on('success', (payload) => {
            console.log('success');
        })
        .on('error', (err) => {
            console.warn(err);
        });

The following will call the **Calculate.add** block, and print the result:

    rapid.call('Calculate', 'add', {
            num1: 11,
            num2 : 2
        })
        .on('success', (payload) => {
            console.log(payload);
        })
        .on('error', (err) => {
            console.warn(err);
        });

The printed result will be `13`.

**Notice** that the `error` event will also be called if you make an invalid block call (for example - the package you refer to does not exist).

## Files:
Whenever a block in RapidAPI requires a file, you can either pass a URL to the file or a read stream.

### URL:
The following code will call the block MicrosoftComputerVision.analyzeImage with a URL of an image:

```
rapid.call('MicrosoftComputerVision', 'analyzeImage', {
    subscriptionKey : '############################',
    image : 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tntOCGkgt98/maxresdefault.jpg
})
    .on('success', (payload) => {
        console.log('S');
        console.log(payload);
    })
    .on ('error', (payload) => {
        console.log('E');
        console.log(payload);
    });
```

### Read Stream
If the file is locally stored, you can read it using `fs` and pass the read stream to the block, like the following:
```
rapid.call('MicrosoftComputerVision', 'analyzeImage', {
    subscriptionKey : '############################',
    image : fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/m.jpeg')
})
    .on('success', (payload) => {
        console.log('S');
        console.log(payload);
    })
    .on ('error', (payload) => {
        console.log('E');
        console.log(payload);
    });
```

RapidAPI uses the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge) to handle files, so please refer to it for more information.


### Webhooks
After setting up the webhook, you can listen to real-time events via websockets like so:

```
rapid.listen('Slack', 'slashCommand', {token: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE', command: '/slash-command'})
    .on('join', msg => { console.log("join: ", msg); })
    .on('error', msg => { console.log("error: ", msg); })
    .on('message', payload => { console.log("message: ", payload); })
    .on('timeout', reason => { console.log("timeout: ", payload); })
    .on('close', reason => { console.log("close: ", reason); });
```
## Issues:

As this is a pre-release version of the SDK, you may expirience bugs. Please report them in the issues section to let us know. You may use the intercom chat on rapidapi.com for support at any time.
